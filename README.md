# Project Setup Guide

This guide provides a detailed step-by-step process to set up the project on your local machine. By following these instructions, you'll be able to clone the repository, install the necessary Node.js modules, and start the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

1.  **Git**: To clone the repository.

2.  **Node.js**: To run the project and manage dependencies.

3.  **npm** (Node Package Manager): To install and manage project dependencies.

## Step 1: Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project using the `cd` command.

3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
```

Replace `your-username` and `your-project` with the actual repository URL.

## Step 2: Installing Node Modules

1.  Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:
    `cd your-project`

2.  Run the following command to install the required Node.js modules specified in the `package.json` file:
    `npm install`
    This command will download and install all the necessary dependencies

## Step 3: Starting the Project

1.  After the installation is complete, you can start the project by running the following command:
    `npm start`
    This command will initiate the project and launch the application. You should see output indicating that the project is running and listening for incoming requests.
2.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the project.
